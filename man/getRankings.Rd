\usage{
getRankings(
  exprMat,
  plotStats = F,
  cores = max(1, detectCores() - 2),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprMat}{Expression matrix (genes/transcripts as rows, samples as columns)
The expression matrix can also be provided as one of the Bioconductor classes:
\itemize{
\item \link{RangedSummarizedExperiment} and derived classes:
The matrix will be obtained through assay(exprMatrix),
-which will extract the first assay (usually the counts)-
or the assay name given in 'assayName'
\item \link[Matrix]{dgCMatrix-class}:
Sparse matrix
\item \code{ExpressionSet}:
The matrix will be obtained through exprs(exprMatrix)
}}

\item{plotStats}{Should the function plot the expression boxplots/histograms?
(TRUE / FALSE). These plots can also be produced
with the function \code{\link[AUCell]{plotGeneCount}}.}

\item{cores}{\code{integer}, number of computing workers.}

\item{verbose}{Should the function show progress messages? (TRUE / FALSE)}
}
\value{
a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object.
}
\description{
Builds the "rankings" for each sample: expression-based ranking for all the genes/transcripts in each sample
The genes/transcripts with same expression value are shuffled. Therefore, genes/transcripts with expression '0' are randomly sorted at the end of the ranking.
These "rankings" can be seen as a new representation of the original dataset. Once they are calculated, they can be saved for future analyses.
