\title{Perform the functional association test}
\usage{
fat(data, min.size = 60, trim = 0.025)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame}, contains training data for one RBP and one event type}

\item{min.size}{\code{integer}, the minimum size of "reliable" training set, default to \code{60}.}

\item{trim}{\code{numeric}, the percentile used to trim the training data. This is useful in producing a more robust estimation of functional association.}
}
\description{
This is a learning one unit of SURF.
It trains a GLM model for the functional association of one RBP with one ATR event.
