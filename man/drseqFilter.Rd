\usage{
drseqFilter(
  event,
  drseq.fdr = 0.05,
  read.length = 100,
  min.adjMean = 0.05,
  filter.overlap.event = T,
  verbose = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{event}{a \code{surf} object output by \link{drseqFit}.}

\item{drseq.fdr}{\code{numeric}, FDR (BH procedure) adjusted p-value cut-off.}

\item{read.length}{\code{numeric}, RNA-seq read length. Default is 100 bp (e.g., Illumina TruSeq). This is used to adjust event base count, which is then used to select the representative events if replicated.}

\item{min.adjMean}{\code{numeric}, adjusted event base mean threshold.}

\item{filter.overlap.event}{\code{logical}, whether (default to \code{TRUE}) to select one representitive event from overlapping ones and remove the others.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}, whether (default to \code{FALSE}) to print out basic summary statistics.}
}
\value{
a \code{surf} object, with three columns added:
\item{adjMean}{adjusted base mean of the event from RNA-seq data.}
\item{group}{group labels of ATR events, \code{increase} for increased REU upon RBP knock-down, and \code{decrease} for decreased, and \verb{no change} for no-changed.}
\item{included}{logical, indicating whether the event is included into SURF ananlysis module 2.}
}
\description{
Filter DrSeq results for the analysis module 2 of SURF (DASeq).
