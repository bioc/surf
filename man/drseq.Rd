\arguments{
\item{event}{a \code{surf} object from \link{parseEvent}.}

\item{sampleData}{\code{data.frame}, describes the RNA-seq samples, contains at least two columns -- \code{bam} and \code{condition}, the row.names represent sample names.}

\item{design}{
    A formula which specifies the design of the experiment. It must
    specify an interaction term between a variable from the sampleData
    columns with the 'exon' variable. By default, the design 
    will be '~ sample + exon + condition:exon'. This formula indicates
    the contrast between 'condition' and exon', i.e. differences in exon 
    usage due to changes in the 'condition' variable.  See the vignette 
    for more examples of other designs.
  }

\item{remove.overlap.exon}{\code{logical}, remove overlaping exons across genes (default to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{anno.prefix}{\code{character}, file names for outputting annotation files.}

\item{anno.format}{\code{character}, e.g. "gtf", as accepted by \link{rtracklayer::export}.}

\item{...}{parameters for \link{Rsubread::featureCounts}.}

\item{drseq.fdr}{\code{numeric}, FDR (BH procedure) adjusted p-value cut-off.}

\item{read.length}{\code{numeric}, RNA-seq read length. Default is 100 bp (e.g., Illumina TruSeq). This is used to adjust event base count, which is then used to select the representative events if replicated.}

\item{min.adjMean}{\code{numeric}, adjusted event base mean threshold.}

\item{filter.overlap.event}{\code{logical}, whether (default to \code{TRUE}) to select one representitive event from overlapping ones and remove the others.}

\item{cores}{\code{integer}, number of available workers, sent to \code{nthreads} of \code{featureCounts}.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical}, whether (\code{TRUE}) to echo progess.}
